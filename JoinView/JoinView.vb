Public Class JoinView
    '
    ' This class, and the related classes in this file, form a replacement for System.Data.DataView
    ' that can be used in a Windows Form DataGrid control to display and edit fields from a DataTable
    ' and also display fields from related parent tables. It is not really intended for use outside
    ' this scenario since the standard DataView and hierarchical binding will suffice. It uses a
    ' DataView internally as the root source of data. An ArrayList is also used to provide support
    ' for sorting (specifically to allow support for fields that aren't in the base DataView).
    '
    ' Specific functionality supported:
    '  - Specifying a limited subset of fields to expose
    '  - Specifying field display order
    '  - Specifying an alias for field names
    '  - Specifying fields in related parent tables for read-only use - i.e. not editable
    '  - Sorting by clicking the DataGrid column header
    '  - Row delete - you can turn this off
    '  - Row add - you can turn this off
    '  - Row edit (with undo) - you can turn this off
    '  - Searching via the Find method
    '  - Filtering rows - done in the constructor - further filtering is not supported
    '  - Sorting the rows - once a sort has been performed,
    '    there is not way to undo it other than sort on a different column
    '  - Enumerating the list
    '
    ' Functionality not supported:
    '  - Filtering the JoinView after it has been constructed
    '  - There is no active filtering. i.e.
    '     - If a record is altered to make it fall outside the original filter,
    '       it will remain in the list rather than be dropped
    '     - If a new record falls outside the original filter,
    '       it will remain in the list rather than be dropped
